1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
/home/stu13/s3/mrc1613

2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
ls

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
cd Courses

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.
    
    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	:  2 points
-Wall -Wextra -pedantic
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.

unused variable b warning can be fixed by removing b. 

control reaches end of non void function can both be solved by making the function return what b used to be equal to. 

ISO C forbids zero size array 'z' can be fixed by deleting z, the function is only suppose to print 1 line so it doesn't make sense for it to exist. 

x is uninitialized - I changed this to int x = 1918; so that x+y would equal 2018 and x would be initialized  

 
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
	does it catch in warning.c?

I'm guessing this question is about the 0 size array, it's because in C arrays must have memory allocated to them when they're initialized. 

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
-std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess 
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

    1. Preprocess
    2. compile
    3. assemble
    4. linking
